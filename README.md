# Design and Verification of a Cache Coherence Protocol using Murphi  
### PA2 - Design and Verification of a Cache Coherence Protocol (MSI, MESI) using Murphi
  https://www.eecs.umich.edu/courses/eecs570/discussions/w23/assignment_2.html

### Final Project - Implementation and Verification of the SWEL Cache Coherence Protocol
The MESI protocol is a widely used cache coherence protocol that has been extensively studied and optimized. However, it has limitations in terms of coherence overhead and memory traffic, especially in systems with low sharing or high contention. We present a formal verification of two optimized protocols: SWEL (Shared, Written, Exclusivity Level) and MOESI (Modified, Owned, Exclusive, Shared, Invalid). We use the Murphi model checking language to verify the correctness of these protocols and compare them to the classic MESI protocol.
